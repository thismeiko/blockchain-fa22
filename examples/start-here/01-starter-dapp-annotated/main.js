/* MAIN() (PLEASE READ)

Because dApps require reading data from a blockchain (an asynchronous process), creating a primary asynchronous function to contain all our code (the main() function in this case) simplifies things. There are a number of required steps to initialize this dApp so that it may connect to "Web3", and also properly inform the user of any steps they might need to take to interact with the dApp.

Much of the code in the upper part of the main() function is good code to include in any dApp you create; some of it is required for any dApp you make, and some of it is good to include in order to improve the user experience of the page

SCROLL DOWN TOWARD THE BOTTOM OF THE MAIN() FUNCTION TO ADD YOUR OWN CODE

// USER EXPERIENCE FEATURES:
  1. Display a spinning loading icon while waiting for user input (like signing a transaction)
  2. Alert user if they are using a browser that isn't Web3 compatible
  3. Alert user to install MetaMask if they don't have it.
  4. Disable the 'Connect' button once the user has connected
  5. Display a 'Connection Status'
